A place for like-minded quality assurance people to come together to help test Mattermost’s software.
If you like breaking software, have a keen eye for UI-related bugs and want to help report your findings, here’s how you can join our testing community. You can find help and more information in the following places:

There are a few ways the community can get involved with testing:

Exploratory testing
This is where testers explore the software (can be on webapp, mobile apps or desktop app) and give feedback on anything they think doesn’t make sense or is difficult to navigate or understand. You can download the desktop and mobile apps here: https://mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps 
Exploratory testing assignments can be located here: https://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/issues/2  


Feature testing (ad-hoc)
Pre-production features, or features already in production are tested from a feature spec
When feature testing assignments are available, they will be located here: https://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/issues (to-do - spreadsheet, spec and instructions)

Release testing
We test the software on the release branch approximately 2 weeks before release (monthly on the 16th) so we can report any bugs. 
When release testing assignments are available, they will be located here: https://github.com/mattermost/quality-assurance/issues (to-do spreadsheet similar to Test Automation Hackfest spreadsheet and instructions)
